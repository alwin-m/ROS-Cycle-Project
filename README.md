ROS Cycle – Open Source Menstrual Cycle Tracker

ROS Cycle is an open source project designed to help women and girls better understand their menstrual health. The application makes it simple to record the date of the last period, cycle length, and period duration, then uses this information to calculate upcoming cycles.

With these details, ROS Cycle can:

Predict menstrual cycles for the next 12 months.

Display cycle dates in a clear, calendar-based view.

Estimate ovulation (egg release) windows, helping users better understand their fertility patterns.

The goal of ROS Cycle is to provide an easy-to-use, transparent, and privacy-friendly tool for menstrual awareness. Since it’s open source, the project can be expanded with new features—ranging from personalized health insights to reminders, wellness tips, or even integrations with healthcare apps.

ROS Cycle is not just a tracker—it’s a learning companion for menstrual health, with room to grow through community-driven updates and improvements.
