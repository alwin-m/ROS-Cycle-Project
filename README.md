ROS Cycle, Open Source Menstrual Cycle Tracker

ROS Cycle is an open source project that helps women and girls understand their menstrual health. The application makes it easy to log the date of the last period, the cycle length, and the duration of periods. It then uses this information to predict future cycles.

With these details, ROS Cycle can:

- Predict menstrual cycles for the next 12 months.
- Show cycle dates in a clear calendar view.
- Estimate ovulation windows, helping users understand their fertility patterns.

The goal of ROS Cycle is to offer a simple, open, and privacy-friendly tool for menstrual awareness. Because it’s open source, the project can grow with new features like personalized health insights, reminders, wellness tips, or even connections to healthcare apps.

ROS Cycle is not just a tracker; it’s a learning companion for menstrual health, with potential for growth through community-driven updates and improvements.
